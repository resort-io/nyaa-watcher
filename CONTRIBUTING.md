## Reporting Bugs

> ### Before Reporting a Bug
> 
> * Make sure that you are using the latest version and have read the [documentation](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/blob/main/SETUP.md) and [Wiki pages](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/wiki) to ensure the bug is not a configuration error.
> * Search through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How to Report a Bug

Bug reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/issues) with the ***[BUG]*** prefix in the title.

* Navigate to the [new issue page](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/issues/new/choose) and select the **Bug Report** template.
* Use a **clear and descriptive title** with the ***[BUG]*** prefix and the ***bug*** label.
* Copy the **debug log message** from the watcher and paste into the issue textarea.
  * The debug log message can be obtained by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` and restarting the watcher.
* Provide **any information** about the bug, such as steps that can possibly reproduce the bug.
* Provide **code changes** if you have any suggestions on how to fix the bug.

## Suggesting Features

### How to Suggest a Feature

Feature suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/issues) with the ***[FEAT]*** prefix in the title.

* Navigate to the [new issue page](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/issues/new/choose) and select the **Feature Suggestion** template.
* Use a **clear and descriptive title** with the ***[FEAT]*** prefix and the ***enhancement*** label.
* Provide a **description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* Describe **how the suggested feature will change the current behavior**.
* Explain **why the feature would be beneficial to most**, if not all, nyaa-watcher users.
* You can **include screenshots** to help you demonstrate how the feature should work or to point out the part at which the suggestion is related to.
* Provide **code changes** if you have any suggestions on how to implement the feature.

## Creating Pull Requests

Since this project adds features with each release, pull requests will be merged into the `develop` branch, and then the `main` as a stable release.

> ### Before Creating a Pull Request
> 
> I ask to please only submit pull requests that are meaningful and relevant to the project, and are not just syntax/grammar changes.
> If you are unsure about your pull request, you can make a [discussion post](https://github.com/resort-io/nyaa-watcher/discussions) to get feedback from the maintainers and the community.
